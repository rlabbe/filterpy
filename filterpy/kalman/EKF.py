class ExtendedKalmanFilter(object):

    """ Implements an extended Kalman filter (EKF). You are responsible for
    setting the various state variables to reasonable values; the defaults
    will  not give you a functional filter.

    You will have to set the following attributes after constructing this
    object for the filter to perform properly. Please note that there are
    various checks in place to ensure that you have made everything the
    'correct' size. However, it is possible to provide incorrectly sized
    arrays such that the linear algebra can not perform an operation.
    It can also fail silently - you can end up with matrices of a size that
    allows the linear algebra to work, but are the wrong shape for the problem
    you are trying to solve.

    Attributes
    ----------
    x : numpy.array(dim_x, 1)
        State estimate vector

    P : numpy.array(dim_x, dim_x)
        Covariance matrix

    R : numpy.array(dim_z, dim_z)
        Measurement noise matrix

    Q : numpy.array(dim_x, dim_x)
        Process noise matrix

    F : numpy.array()
        State Transition matrix

    H : numpy.array(dim_x, dim_x)
        Measurement function

    y : numpy.array
        Residual of the update step. Read only.

    K : numpy.array(dim_x, dim_z)
        Kalman gain of the update step. Read only.

    S :  numpy.array
        Systen uncertaintly projected to measurement space. Read only.

    log_likelihood : float
        log-likelihood of the last measurement. Read only.

    Examples
    --------

        Parameters
        ----------

        dim_x : int
            Number of state variables for the Kalman filter. For example, if
            you are tracking the position and velocity of an object in two
            dimensions, dim_x would be 4.

            This is used to set the default size of P, Q, and u

        dim_z : int
            Number of of measurement inputs. For example, if the sensor

        compute_log_likelihood : bool (default = True)
            Computes log likelihood by default, but this can be a slow
